## Cover Letter

Dear [Client Name/Team],

Thank you for the opportunity to submit a proposal for your project on collecting and structuring university-related data using the Perplexity API.  
I am confident that my strong Python background, experience with API integrations, and attention to detail make me an excellent fit for this task.

## Proposal Overview

### Understanding of Your Needs

You require a robust, automated Python solution that:
- Queries the Perplexity API with custom prompts to extract key university data (name, location, number of students, website, programs, etc.).
- Parses and validates the responses, outputting clean, structured JSON ready for business database integration.
- Handles API rate limits and errors gracefully.
- Is well-documented and easy to use for your team or future integration.

---

### My Solution

I will deliver:
- **A Streamlit-based Python application** packaged with Docker for easy deployment and use.
- User-friendly interface: input one or many university names; results are fetched, validated, and shown as structured JSON, with download option.
- **Full setup instructions**: Including Docker build/run steps, .env handling for API keys, and sample usage.
- **Extensive documentation**: Code comments and a README for smooth handover.
- Sample output JSON for a selection of test universities.

---

### Why Choose Me

- **Strong Python & API Integration Skills:** Years of experience with Python, API consumption (REST, LLMs), and data wrangling.
- **Detail-Oriented:** Commitment to data accuracy, validation, and clean output.
- **Communication:** Regular updates & responsive to feedback.
- **Deliverable-Ready:** The solution will be easy for your team to run, even with minimal technical background.

---

### Timeline

- **Initial Demo:** Within 2-3 days of project start.
- **Final Delivery:** 5-7 working days, including revisions and documentation.

---

### Next Steps

- Please share your Perplexity API key (or I can provide an interface for you to insert it securely).
- Let me know if you have a list of sample universities for first testing, or any adjustments to the data fields.

Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to working together to deliver a solution that fully meets your needs!

Best regards,
